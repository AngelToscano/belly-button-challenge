# belly-button-challenge

This was the hardest challenge yet. I am still not sure how I managed it.

Here is what is included:
    1. css code for the html
    2. html code
    3. javescript code to grab data from a jason and but data into graphs and display it on the html


I also tried to make the github host the html, but not sure if it is working.
